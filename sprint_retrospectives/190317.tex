\subsection*{Time spent working on project}
\begin{itemize}
    \item
    Per-Morten: 12h

    \item
    Trond:      14h
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{What went wrong}
\subsubsection*{General}
\begin{itemize}
    \item
    Group members got sick.

    \item
    CMake Google test did not function properly, leading to a lot of time trying to make it work.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Trond}
\begin{itemize}
    \item 
    Nothing outside of the general.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Per-Morten}
\begin{itemize}
    \item
    Got sick. Which ruined both parts of this sprint, and what should have been sprint 7.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{What went right}
\subsubsection*{General}
\begin{itemize}
    \item
    Quite productive when people weren't sick.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Trond}
\begin{itemize}
    \item
    Run test script is starting to look quite fancy.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Per-Morten}
\begin{itemize}
    \item
    Implementing the queue went faster than expected, as I already had a previous implementation available.

    \item
    Researching and implementing the thread pool went faster than expected.
\end{itemize}


\subsection*{What should we do differently}
\subsubsection*{General}
\begin{itemize}
    \item
    Nothing obvious to do differently, the two days we worked were quite efficient.
\end{itemize}

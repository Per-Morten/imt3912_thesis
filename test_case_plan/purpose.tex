\section{Purpose}

\noindent The test case plan is meant to outline in a rough manner how the test cases are supposed to accomplish, how they are performed and how we measure the performance of said tests.
In general in these test cases we want to try as much as possible to make the performance measurements represent the specific case we are testing.
This means that we want to avoid using components that deals with code that we do not have full control over, like the Box2D and OpenGL code.
For each test want to use both different compilers and profilers to make sure the readings are accurate.

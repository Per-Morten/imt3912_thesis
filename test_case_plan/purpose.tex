\section{Purpose}

\noindent The test case plan is meant to outline in a rough manner how the test cases are supposed to accomplish, how they are performed and how we measure the performance of said tests.
In general in these test cases we want to try as much as possible to make the performance measurements represent the specific case we are testing.
We want to use some components we don't have full control over, as that will be a part of the normal usage of the engine, however, the performance of our code should be what is represented through our test results. 
For each test want to use both different compilers and profilers to make sure the readings are accurate.

\subsection{Compilation time}
The compilation time should be kept as low as possible when building the engine.


\subsubsection*{How the test is performed}
There are a few ways to measure this.

\begin{itemize}

    \item \noindent\textit{Complete compilation}\\
    There are occurrences where you would recompile your entire project, but they are rare.
    However, they happen often enough that it is worth testing, but is not the test we value the most.

    \item \noindent\textit{Partial compilation}\\
    A bit harder to test, but the most frequent type of compilation is when you use the engine for developing your own game.
    This results in small parts of the engine being recompiled after each change.
    The most common occurrence of this would be when adding additional components to the engine.

\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{How the test is measured}
Tested by timing the time it takes to compile the engine. Should also be measured using different compilers to ensure the results are consistent.

\subsection{Compilation Time}
The compilation time should be kept as low as possible when building the engine.


\subsubsection*{How the Test is Performed}
There are a few ways to measure this.

\begin{itemize}

    \item \noindent\textit{Complete compilation}\\
    There are occurrences where you would recompile your entire project, but they are rare.
    However, they happen often enough that it is worth testing, but is not the test we value the most. This test should simply recompile the entire engine from scratch.

    \item \noindent\textit{Partial compilation}\\
    The more realistic case is when a small part of the engine is recompiled.
    This most often occurs when a new component is added to the engine, so it is fit to test that scenario.
    It also is easy to test by measuring the amount of time taken to compile by adding a new trivial component to the engine.
    This is done when the engine was completely compiled beforehand, so only the addition of the new component affects the compilation time.

\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{How the Test is Measured}
Tested by timing the time it takes to compile the engine and the project. 
Should also be measured using different compilers to ensure the results are consistent.

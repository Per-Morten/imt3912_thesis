\subsection{Fast spawning}
The creation of new actors and their components should be done as fast as possible.
This is an issue in the NOX Engine, where creating a lot of new actors or components at the same time causes frame rate issues.

\subsubsection*{How the test is performed}
Make it so that a significant enough number of actors are spawned so that it has an impact on the frame rate.
There will be several different versions of this case.

\begin{itemize}

    \item\noindent\textit{Empty actors}\\


    \item\noindent\textit{Actors with an empty component}\\

\end{itemize}

In each case there will be 100000 actors spawned as fast as possible.
The amount of time taken spawning the actors is recorded.


\subsubsection*{How the test is measured}
We then measure how long it takes for all of the actors to be spawned, along with various other metrics from several profilers.

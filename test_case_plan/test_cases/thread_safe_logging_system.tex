\subsection{Thread safe logging system}
Show that the logging system has the possibility to function in a multi-threaded environment without any issues.

\subsubsection*{How the test is performed}
The test is conducted by creating a actors with components that let them continuously send messages to the logging system over a set period. These messages will be sent from different threads to actually test the thread safety of the logging system.

There will be a total of 1000 actors, each with their own messaging component.
The component will send a message each 10 milliseconds.
The message itself will contain the actors id that the logging system prints out to console.
Testing will occur for a full minute, where 60 million messages have been sent and processed.

\subsubsection*{How the test is measured}
Successful if there aren't any crashes or errors over the set amount of time. 
This does not guarantee that there is no issues with the logging system, but is a good indicator that everything is working at an acceptable level.

\subsection{Large number of different components}
This case will test the possibility of having many differently functioning components at once in the engine. 

\subsubsection*{How the test is performed}
The test is performed by first creating 200 or more dummy components that does some simple task. 
We then place out several actors with the components in an otherwise empty world.
We need to create a script which makes all off these components, as it would be a waste of time for us to so by hand.

\subsubsection*{How the test is measured}
As with many of the other tests, it is measured with the profilers to check for cache misses, branch predictions and memory usage.

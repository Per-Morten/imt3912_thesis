\subsection{Large Number of Different Components}
This case will test the possibility of having many differently functioning components at once in the engine. 

\subsubsection*{How the Test is Performed}
The test is performed by first creating 200 or more trivial components that does some simple task. 
Several actors are then created with said components, in an otherwise empty world.
We need to create a script which makes all off these components, as it would be a waste of time for us to do so by hand.

The test will consist of several actors each having a set number of components attached to them.
The program will update everything as normal for a specified amount of time.
The number of actors in the world will be increased with a set amount per test.
The number of components will also change depending on the number of actors used, allowing us to see how the number of components scale with the number of actors.

\subsubsection*{How the Test is Measured}
As with many of the other tests, it is measured with the profilers to check for cache misses, branch predictions, timing and memory usage.

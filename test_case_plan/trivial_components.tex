\section{Trivial Components}
Trivial components are mentioned to a large extent within this plan.
A trivial component is in essence just a mock object.
It will be a component that satisfies all requirements for a component, 
but instead of doing actual game logic related tasks it will only do simple processing to mock regular logic.
Examples of this can be a time specified busy wait within the update function.
The trivial components will be the main bulk of the tests, 
as we don't have the time to create proper components in the scale that some of the tests really need.
The other rationale for this is to ensure that most of the time is spent within our code, and not within external libraries used by the components.
In addition to these trivial components we will also be using some of the standard components to ensure that the rest of the engine partakes in the test. 
For example having graphics components, and physics components.

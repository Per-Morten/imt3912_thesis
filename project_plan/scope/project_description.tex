\subsubsection{Project Description}
We are creating a new entity component system module called NOX-ECS 2 for the NOX-Engine. 
It is going to have a focus on being threaded, having good performance, being maintainable, and achieving the same flexibility as the old entity component system.

\subsubsection*{NOX-ECS 2}
We will develop an entity component system, which will contain all the old functionality of the NOX-Engines system, but with an added benefit of performance and maintainability. 
If the development of this module goes smoothly, it will hopefully be adopted into the NOX-Engine, and subsequently improve the overall quality of the engine.

\subsubsection*{Naive module}
In addition to creating a new entity component system for the NOX-Engine, we will also develop a more naive object oriented version in order to having something akin to a worse case scenario to compare against. 
This implementation will focus more on the performance part, rather than the other aspects, meaning it will be more streamlined towards our samples; 
not being able to do much more than required to replicate said samples.

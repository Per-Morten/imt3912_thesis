\subsection{Project Description}
We are creating a new entity component system module called NOX ECS 2 for the NOX Engine. 
It is going to have a focus on being threaded, having good performance, being maintainable, and achieving the same flexibility as the old entity component system.

\subsubsection{NOX ECS 2}
We will develop an entity component system, which will contain all the old functionality of the NOX Engines system, but with an added benefit of performance and maintainability. 
If the development of this module goes smoothly, it will hopefully be adopted into the NOX Engine, and subsequently improve the overall quality of the engine.

\subsubsection{Delimitation}
\subsubsection*{NOX-ECS 2}
We will only provide the same functionality the old system offered, as doing anything in addition to this would put us on an even tighter time schedule than we already are.

\subsubsection*{Traditional object oriented implementation}
The traditional object oriented implementation is developed with the intention to be able to run the samples like our ECS system and NOX-Engine does, and nothing more.

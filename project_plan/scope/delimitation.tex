\subsubsection{Delimitation}
There are a couple of delimitation for each of our modules:

\subsubsection*{NOX-ECS 2}
\begin{itemize}
    
    \item Will provide the same functionality as the old system.
    \item Improved performance through multi threading and architectural decisions.
    \item Has better maintainability with a more decoupled structure.
    \item Adopting NOX-ECS 2 into the NOX-Engine should be as trivial as possible.
    
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Naive Implementation}
\begin{itemize}
    
    \item Meant to be simple, only doing what the samples requires it to do.
    \item Is object oriented, using inheritance, polymorphism and abstractions.

\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Samples}
There are going to be multiple samples showcasing the strength and weaknesses of each implementation. These are going to include:
\begin{itemize}
    
    \item Sample with lots of insertions, deletions and moves of entities and components, checking the performance of the memory management of the system.
    \item Complex entities and components
    \item Both deep and wide scenegraph examples
    \item Multiple entity compositions that require a large amount of communication, challenging the performance of the messaging system.
    
\end{itemize}

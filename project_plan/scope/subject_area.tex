The bachelor will revolve around the idea of the entity component system, which is a design pattern commonly used in game engines, Unity and Unreal to name a few. 
The pattern tries to make it possible to create entities, which is a composition of components, where each component has its each unique separate feature. 
Different types of combinations of components will result in entities with different functionality. 
It is this feature of entity component system which gives the larger game engines the possibility to cover such a huge range of games.

For NOX-ECS 2 we will mainly focus on the performance side, and trying to improve it with data-oriented design and multi-threading. 
This means we will try to structure our implementation in a way that utilizes memory and cache mechanisms as optimally as possible, as well as a focus on effective multi-threading support.

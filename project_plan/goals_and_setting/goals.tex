\section*{Goals}
This project will have a deep focus on entity component systems, both in a practical sense and theoretical sense.
The goals of the project is therefore:
\begin{itemize}
    \item 
        Give insight into different Entity Component Systems. 
        This is done through published articles, as well as our own development and testing.
    
    \item 
        Implement a functioning Entity Component System that can work within the NOX Engine.
        The new ECS should have the same functionality as the old one, as well as improved performance
        through a more efficient architecture, memory use, multi-threading and a DOD mindset.

    \item
        Give insight into performance differences in a relevant test case. 
        This case will be done with both the original NOX Entity system, our proposed system,
        as well as a more standard Object Oriented solution.
\end{itemize}

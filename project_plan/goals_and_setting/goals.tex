\subsection{Goals}
This project will have a deep focus on entity component systems, both in a practical sense and theoretical sense.
The goals of the project is therefore:
\begin{itemize}
    \item 
        Give insight into different entity component systems. 
        This is done through published articles, as well as our own development and testing.
    
    \item 
        Implement a functioning entity component system that can work within the NOX Engine.
        The new ECS should have the same functionality as the old one, as well as improved performance.

    \item
        Give insight into performance differences in a relevant test case. 
        This case will be done with both the original NOX Entity system and our proposed systems.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Setting}
The following section looks at some of the factors that influence our project.

\subsubsection{Legal Setting}
The NOX Engine is open source under an MIT license. 
This license is something we have to take into account when developing the new ECS.

\subsubsection{Scientific Setting}
There does not seem to be a great deal of academic articles published in relation to this topic,
however what we actually have found seem to be of high quality.
This means that we will also have to look into non-academic literature. 
Luckily there seems to exists more sources within the non-academic literature, 
written by industry professionals.

\subsubsection{Time}
The bachelor thesis has a hard delivery date in the middle of May. 
This means we have to structure our project around this deadline.

\section*{Documentation}
Writing the thesis report will be a continuous effort throughout the entire semester,
however it takes over the main focus after the milestones has been reached.
We have set off 18 days to write the thesis, including 2 days to review it.
We also have some days as a buffer as we have not taken weekends into account in the diagram.

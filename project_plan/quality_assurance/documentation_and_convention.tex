\subsection{Intention}
The idea of this project is to end up delivering a functional product to Suttung digital,
meaning the product will be used in a professional setting.
As a result of this goal, special care has to be put into quality assurance.

\ptparagraph{Coding Convention}
Coding conventions will as far as feasible follow the internal coding conventions of Suttung digital.
Conventions that does not follow the original conventions of Suttung will be discussed with Suttung.
No matter how the final coding conventions ends up looking, the focus will always be on writing
readable, maintainable and well performing code.
This will be enforced through routine code reviews and testing.

\ptparagraph{Documentation}
Documentation will be a huge factor, as the documentation as well as examples is what 
Suttung will be reading to gain an understanding of the new ECS. 
All interfaces will be documented, even self-explanatory ones, as what is and what is not
self-explanatory can change from person to person.
The exact format of the documentation will be cleared with Suttung.

\ptparagraph{Git Usage}
All developed code will be stored on git. 
To avoid breaking builds for the other group member,
all implementation of new features will happen on separate branches.
Branches will be merged into the master branch when the new code has been tested, and reviewed 
by a fellow group member.

\section*{Mitigation Strategies}
Bellow follows our strategies for mitigating the chances of the identified risks happening.
And how we might deal with them if they would occur.

\subsection*{Poor Performance}
Performance problems will be mitigated through recurring profiling.
Benchmarks should ideally be run quite often,
and these benchmarks should guide further optimizations if needed.

\subsection*{Incompatible Implementation}
The implementation will first go through a design phase,
before it is presented to Suttung. 
This proposed design will be built on the research
that have been conducted into the Suttung engine,
as well as a relevant test case.
Hopefully this will be enough to mitigate the changes
of our implementation being incompatible with the NOX Engine.

\subsection*{Multi-threaded Related Bugs}
Reducing the risk of multi-threaded bugs is a difficult task, 
however some general guidelines helps when developing multi-threaded code.
We will have a focus on clear access patterns,
and local scope when writing multi-threaded code.
There might also be some libraries out there that
allows us to build tests specifically aimed at
multi-threaded code.

\subsection*{Unrepresentative Test Case}
\todo{Get confirmation on access to Suttung game repo}
The test case will be developed based on usage patterns
observed in real life use of the NOX Engine.
The plan is also to verify the case with Suttung.

\subsection*{Lost Work}
All of the source code will be uploaded to on-line repositories, 
this will also apply to the thesis itself, as well as
all other documents related to the project.
The group members are encouraged to commit work to these repositories often,
preferably after each discrete "unit of work".

\subsection*{Internal Conflict}
Both members of the group have worked together previously on project,
which has gone quite well. 
Because of this we have not added extra mitigation factors, 
outside of the group rules.

\subsection*{Problem Understanding the NOX Engine}
The best way to mitigate this risk is to use more time with the engine.
We will therefore write the test cases that we are
going to use for comparisons in the NOX Engine first.

\todo{Get Go signal on this: Suttung will also give us access to one of their games which is built with the NOX Engine.}

\subsection*{Missing Group Members}
Missing group members is hard to mitigate, however 
we will through daily meetings keep the other member
up to date on what we are working on. 
Hopefully this will lessen the impact if a group member
does not show up one day.
In addition group members are encouraged to work remotely when possible,
if they for some reason cannot show up for work.

\section*{Mitigation Strategies}
Bellow follows our strategies for mitigating the chances of the identified risks happening.
And how we might deal with them if they would occur.

\subsection*{Poor Performance}
Performance problems will be mitigated through recurring profiling.
Benchmarks should ideally be run quite often,
and these benchmarks should guide further optimizations if needed.

\subsection*{Incompatible Implementation}
The implementation will first go through a design phase,
before it is presented to Suttung. 
This proposed design will be built on the research
that have been conducted into the Suttung engine,
as well as a relevant test case.
Hopefully this will be enough to mitigate the changes
of our implementation being incompatible with the NOX Engine.

\subsection*{Multi-threaded Related Bugs}
Reducing the risk of multi-threaded bugs is a difficult task, 
however some general guidelines helps when developing multi-threaded code.
We will have a focus on clear access patterns,
and local scope when writing multi-threaded code.
There might also be some libraries out there that
allows us to build tests specifically aimed at
multi-threaded code.

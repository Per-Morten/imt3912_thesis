\section*{Identified Risks}
Bellow follows the identified risks related to this project, 
as well as the consequences related to the individual risks.

\subsection*{Poor performance}
Performance is a pretty hard topic, especially when combined with
systems as complicated as ECS's.\\
\textbf{Probability}: Medium\\
\textbf{Impact}: Medium

\ptparagraph{Consequence}
A poor performing system would mean that we would have to spend more time
optimizing the ECS, which could get in the way of the other tasks.
A suboptimal solution would probably not be something Suttung would be interested
in using either.

\subsection*{Incompatible Implementation}
The main goal of this project is to allow Suttung to easily integrate the new ECS
into their system. 
However it might be that our system ends up fundamentally different than theirs,
and that the integration is not an easy process.
\textbf{Probability}: Medium\\
\textbf{Impact}: High

\ptparagraph{Consequence} 
An incompatible implementation would mean that the Suttung group would not be able to
easily integrate the ECS into their systems without major changes. 
In this case Suttung might decide that the new ECS is not worth it,
and stay with their current solution.

\subsection*{Multi-threaded Related Bugs}
Writing multi-threaded code is a difficult challenge, and finding bugs in multi-threaded
code is even more difficult and time consuming.
\textbf{Probability}: High\\
\textbf{Impact}: Depends

\ptparagraph{Consequence}
The consequence of a multi-threaded related bug depends on what sort of bug, 
and how fatal it is. Non fatal bugs with low recurrence is obviously not wanted,
but it might be acceptable. This cannot be said for fatal program terminating bugs
that recur with a high frequency.

\subsection{Important project characteristics}
Our bachelor project has several characteristics which affect how we select our development model:

\begin{itemize}

    \item Only two people doing the development, meaning that the development model accordingly needs to have an appropriate scale.
    \item Need to be agile, still many aspects that are unknown about this project.
    \item A need for an iterative process, as we have multiple modules that needs to be developed.
    \item We would like to incorporate multiple practices to ensure a sufficient amount of artifacts are produced to help in writing the thesis.
    \item Want to have the whole process well documented, in order to still have a good grip of how the whole process went at the end of the bachelor. 

\end{itemize}

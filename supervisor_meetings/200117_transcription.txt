Change of thesis direction.
- Wanted a change of thesis direction.
    - Did not feel we could contribute properly to the NOX engine, or that our main areas of interest were not that relevant.
    - Changing the NOX engine to be multithreaded would require to much work,
    and be to much of a risk.
- Agreed with Mariusz to change the direction to a comparison/guideline study.
    - We will create some samples within the NOX engine, FTCP Engine and Unity,
        - We will compare the performance from the samples, as well as some thoughts on usability, maintainability. 
    - The end result of the thesis is some thoughts and guidelines surrounding the topic of creating an own engine.
For next meeting:
- Give a list of all the features we think of implementing and testing, ranked according to prioritization.

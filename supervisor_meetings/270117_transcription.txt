Meeting - Mariusz Nowostawski
Topic: Project Plan Review.
Need to change problem approach in certain ways.
We need to identify performance metrics before we start with the implementations.
The performance metrics will be based on specs supplied by and agreed upon with Suttung.
Remove arbitrary choices, like DOD sections. 
Remove OOP inheritance implementation, as it is irrelevant.

Topic: Tests
The metrics measuring performance should be as static as possible, (can be checked with Suttung).
this is also important for the tests themselves, however they are allowed to be more flexible, 
as they are glued more on top of the test cases.

Topic: New Suggested Iteration Loop
1. Start with specs supplied by Suttung, use these to decide upon metrics.
2. Create ECS design based on specs, research and previous iteration data.
3. Implement suggested system.
4. Write Test Case/Game.
5. Do performance Tests on Test Case/Game.
6. If time for more iterations, go to pt. 2.
7. Integrate new ECS into NOX Engine.

Suttung will probably be involved in several steps of the iteration loop.

Topic: New Milestones
Milestone 1. Agree on specs and metrics.
Milestone 2 & 3. Implemented and tested a proposed ECS.
Milestone 4. Integrate ECS into NOX Engine and Gamejam with Suttung.

Topic: Time Estimation
Add in some time buffers where we rely on stakeholders. 
For example in regard to agreeing on metrics and specs.
Extra buffer time can be used for more iterations or thesis report towards the end of the project.

Topic: Group Rules
Add more explanation regarding consequences, and how we keep track of and document rule violations.
The explanation can focus on dealing with repeated offenses.
Can remove links to git rules and code conventions, as they are not required in the project plan.

Topic: Quality Assurance
Don't need a focus on the QA of the thesis, as we are only at bachelor level,
however the QA regarding implementation seems ok.

Test Cases:

- Write run test script.                                        2h 30m              Trond
- Run tests over night:

    - NOX: Run Fast Spawning test.                              N/A                 Trond       XXX 
    - NOX: Run Numerous Unique Components test.                 N/A                 Trond       XXX
    - NOX: Run Memory Usage test.                               N/A                 Trond       XXX

Total Time:                                                                                 
PMS:   19h (The rest of the time is spent on items on hold)     61h
Trond: 42h 

Hold (To be done if time):
- Write Get Components Test.                                    1h                  PMS         XX
    - Rationale: Components have been used for some time now, so any bugs should have already popped up, and other tasks have higher priority. Bugs will possibly show up in the test cases instead, and be fixed there.
- Write Assign Component Test.                                  1h 30m              PMS         XX 
    - Rationale: Components have been used for some time now, so any bugs should have already popped up, and other tasks have higher priority. Bugs will possibly show up in the test cases instead, and be fixed there.
- Write SmartHandle tests.                                      2h                  PMS         XX
    - Rationale: Components have been used for some time now, so any bugs should have already popped up, and other tasks have higher priority. Bugs will possibly show up in the test cases instead, and be fixed there.
- Create Lifecycle asserts                                      2h                  PMS         X
    - Rationale: Other tasks have higher priority.
- Write unit-test for events.                                   1h                  PMS         X
    - Rationale: Other tasks have higher priority, also it will be used in the test cases, meaning that potential bugs can be uncovered there.
- Support subtasks in estimation script.                        2h                  PMS         X
    - Rationale: While this task is important, other tasks take more priority.

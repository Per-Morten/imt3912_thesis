Total Time:                                                                                 
PMS:   17h     (Rest of the time is spent on items on hold)     30h 30m
Trond: 13h 30m (Rest of the time is spent on items on hold) 

Hold (To be done if time):
- Json Type Information
    - Rationale: Not required for the thesis, will be implemented after the thesis is over, before delivering the product.
- Write Get Components Test.                                    1h                  PMS         XX
    - Rationale: Components have been used for some time now, so any bugs should have already popped up, and other tasks have higher priority. Bugs will possibly show up in the test cases instead, and be fixed there.
- Write Assign Component Test.                                  1h 30m              PMS         XX 
    - Rationale: Components have been used for some time now, so any bugs should have already popped up, and other tasks have higher priority. Bugs will possibly show up in the test cases instead, and be fixed there.
- Write SmartHandle tests.                                      2h                  PMS         XX
    - Rationale: Components have been used for some time now, so any bugs should have already popped up, and other tasks have higher priority. Bugs will possibly show up in the test cases instead, and be fixed there.
- Create Lifecycle asserts                                      2h                  PMS         X
    - Rationale: Other tasks have higher priority.
- Write unit-test for events.                                   1h                  PMS         X
    - Rationale: Other tasks have higher priority, also it will be used in the test cases, meaning that potential bugs can be uncovered there.
- Support subtasks in estimation script.                        2h                  PMS         X
    - Rationale: While this task is important, other tasks take more priority.

- NOX: Write about Compilation time test.                       2h                  Trond       XX
- NOX: Write about Fast Spawning test.                          2h                  PMS         XX

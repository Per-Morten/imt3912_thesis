\section{Standard Components}
In addition to the new ECS some standard components will also be created, these are components that are needed in several different projects, 
and that are already standard within the NOX Actor system.

\begin{itemize}
    \item
    Transform

    \item
    Children

    \item
    Parent

    \item
    Graphics

    \item
    Sprite 

    \item
    Light

    \item
    Gravitation

    \item
    Physics

    \item
    2dDirectionControl

    \item
    2dRotationControl

    \item
    Control

    \item
    Type Information
\end{itemize}

Interfaces for the NOX version of these components can be found in:

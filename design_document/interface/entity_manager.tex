\subsection{EntityManager}
Interface: Figure~\ref{lst:entity_manager}\\\noindent
The EntityManager is at the heart of the new entity system.
It can be seen as a merge between the old world and actor classes.

The EntityManager is also the main entry point for working with the new ECS,
as it gives access to creation of entities, updating of entities, access to components as well as access to the internal entity event system.

Some boilerplate are still required to get the EntityManager up and going, 
just like that last system, all components needs to be registered before they can be created.
In addition the EntityManager needs to be configured before updates can happen.

An example can be seen in figure~\ref{lst:entity_manager_example}.\\

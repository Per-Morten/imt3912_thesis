\subsection{MetaInformation}
\lstinputlisting[language=cpp, caption=MetaInformation.cpp]{../code_samples/meta_information.cpp}
The MetaInformation structure contains all needed information related to the different components within the system.
This includes all the different operations that will be done on components within the ECS.
The meta information is always the first structure that will be queried for operations, and is also used to identify collections of components.
It also contains information on whether or not these components are interested in certain events.
\pttodo{Write about how the meta information will contain event interests}

\subsection{Event}
Interface: Figure~\ref{lst:event}\\\noindent
Currently the new ComponentEvent system will function quite like the original event system, 
with all new events inheriting from an event class. 
The plan is to change this event interface based on how much time we have, 
and also after some discussions with Suttung. 
We already have some concepts for another event system, but to avoid taking on to much to quickly we are sticking with this for the moment.

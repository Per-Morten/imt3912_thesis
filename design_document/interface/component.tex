\subsection{Component}
Interface: Figure~\ref{lst:component}\\\noindent
The Component is the base "interface" for all the component classes. 
It only contains one member, the entityID, which is a unique id used to identify which entity this component belongs to.
All components within the engines must inherit from the Component base class, as the EntityManager only sees and works on Component structures.\\
This base class contains no virtual functions, as the overhead of virtual functions is not wanted.

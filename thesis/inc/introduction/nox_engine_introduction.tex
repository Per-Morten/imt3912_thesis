\section{NOX Engine}
The NOX Engine started its life in "Project NOX" in 2013,
a horror game developed for the PC, as a project for a game programming course.
The development of the engine continued during the development of the game Pyroeis,
which was the graduate project of two of the founding members of Suttung.
Pyroeis had a focus on procedurally generated content, in the form of planetary caves.

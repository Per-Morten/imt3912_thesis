\section{NOX Engine}
The NOX Engine started its life in "Project NOX" in 2013,
a 2D horror game developed for the PC, as a project for a game programming course.
The development of the engine continued through two bachelor projects,
in which both were based on the "Project NOX" code.
After these projects the company Suttung was created, and the game engine
code from "Project NOX" was extracted and turned into the NOX Engine.

\nmtdesc{The thesis examines the implementation of a multi-threaded entity component system.
The entity component system is built for the Norwegian game studio Suttung Digital, and
is based on requirements that are also applicable for other parts of the video game industry.
The thesis looks into some implementation ideas for entity component systems, and
ways to run entity component systems in a multi-threaded environment.
The thesis also analyzes some performance results, when benchmarked against Suttung's existing
actor system, and discusses some of the findings of the system, and how it might be applicable to others.
\todo{This is starting to be ok, but should be better}
TODO: This is the short description of a bachelor thesis. It should contain a short introduction to the area of the thesis and what the thesis contributes to that area.}

\section{Self Evaluation}

\subsection{Overscoped}

\subsection{Late Start}
We went through several different phases of deciding on what the thesis should actually be about,
this meant that we did not get around to starting working with the project as early as we originally
wanted.

\subsection{Division of Labor}
There was a clear division of labor within the project, with Per-Morten mainly developing
the new ECS while Trond were implementing the benchmark test cases.
This was probably not the best division of labor,
as we both ended up working quite a lot in isolation.
Having a more shared division of labor would probably open us both more to critique,
leading to an overall better product.
The clear division of labor was mainly done to make better use of the time we had available.

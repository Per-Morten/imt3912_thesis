\subsection{Layered Execution}
As shown in the benchmarks the layered execution model provides a significant performance boost.
However, there are usages patterns which is non optimal for the layered execution model.
These are mainly cases where there is not enough processing requirements to justify the synchronization costs.
For example if the user is sending a lot of direct events, rather than broadcasted ones,
and the processing required for receiving events is quite short.

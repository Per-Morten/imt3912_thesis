\section{Criticism}
There are several aspects of these findings that can be criticized.

\subsection{Mobile Testing}
Testing on mobile was originally a planned, but this was never accomplished due to lack of time.
This would have been a good way to check if the lock free structures with relaxed atomics actually
gave an increased boost in performance.

\subsection{Single Compiler}
Again due to time constraints we did not have time to run our tests on different compilers.
This means that we did not get to inspect how different compilers might optimize our code differently.

\subsection{Single Platform}
We originally planned to test on both Windows and Ubuntu, while also testing on both our computers to
try with different hardware. However, time only allowed us to test on Ubuntu, and with only one computer.
We are uncertain as to how much difference it would actually be if we also tested on other computers.

\subsection{Counter Test Cases}
Due to lack of time we did not have the option to write different systems to test.
For example it would have been interesting to create a template based entity component system,
to measure against.

\subsection{No User Tests}
We had originally planned to have user tests together with Suttung.
The idea was to arrange a game jam with Suttung over a weekend,
and do tests with them to gather feedback on the new system.
Unfortunately neither we nor Suttung were able to dedicate the time to this when the system
was in a testable state.

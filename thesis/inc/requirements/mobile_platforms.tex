Suttung has expressed a desire for the new ECS to function on mobile platforms.
In terms of multi-threading and performance this posed some interesting challenges.
Mobile platforms in general are not as powerful as regular pc's, both in terms of clock speed, and in terms of memory access.
As mentioned earlier contiguous memory and caching mechanisms are important for good performance on modern hardware.
Because of this, data layout and predictable memory access will be even more important\cite[10:38]{andrei_alexandrescu_quick_code_quickly}.

Additionally many of the popular mobile platforms run on weakly ordered systems, like ARM\cite{preshing_weak_vs_strong_memory_models}.
Traditionally ARM has supplied a weak memory model, meaning that synchronization primitives that ensures sequentially consistent memory ordering
might lead to a performance hit. \todo{Add link to atomic weapons talk by herb sutter, mentioning that later ARM architectures will be seq\_cst}

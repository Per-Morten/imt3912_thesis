\section{Memory Usage}
Suttung has expressed a desired to avoid a heavy increase in memory usage,
within the new ECS.
One of the reasons being that Suttung often use their engine to
make games for mobile platforms, which usually does not have the same memory
capabilities as regular desktop machines.
A goal would therefore be to keep memory usage about the same as the current
NOX Actor system, unless the increase in memory were justified by some performance
gains.

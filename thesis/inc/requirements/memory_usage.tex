\section{Memory Usage}
Suttung has expressed a desire to avoid a significant increase in memory usage,
within the new ECS.
One of the reasons being that Suttung uses their engine to
make games for mobile platforms, which usually does not have the same memory capabilities as regular desktop machines.
A goal is, therefore, to keep memory usage about the same as the current
NOX Actor system, unless the performance gains justify the increase.

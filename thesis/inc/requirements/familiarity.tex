\section{Familiarity}
Suttung uses their current NOX engine for most of their game development.
They are quite familiar with their current actor system, and expressed a desire that the new
ECS should not deviate to far from the original actor system in terms of programming paradigms
and familiarity.
This would allow Suttung to continue creating games without to much loss of productivity while
learning the new system.

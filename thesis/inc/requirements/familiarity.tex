\section{Familiarity}
Suttung uses their current NOX Engine for most of their game development.
They are quite familiar with their current actor system and expressed a desire that the new
ECS should not deviate too far from the original, regarding programming paradigms and familiarity.
It would allow Suttung to continue creating games without too much loss of productivity while learning the new system.

\requirement{NOX ECS shall, if possible, follow the same conventions as the NOX Actor system.}{req:familiarity}

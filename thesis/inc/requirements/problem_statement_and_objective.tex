\section{Final Problem Statement and Objective}
After specifying requirements the objective from Suttung was clear.
They wanted a safe, efficient, non-virtual and template light ECS,
which would also support mobile platforms.

These requirements are not necessarily unique for Suttung,
but can also overlap with requirements of other game developers.
This also motivates the more general discussion of the benchmark results of NOX ECS.

Additional requirements can be seen in the technical specification in appendix \ref{chap:appendix_technical_specification}.

\subsection{Lock-Free Stack}
\label{subsec:detailed_lock_free_stack}
\todo{Write this properly, does not need to be long, but should be written}
\todo{What is below is just general notes}

\subsubsection{Explanation}
Simple stack, taken from cppreference, \todo{Remember to add source!}

\subsubsection{Motivation}
Wanted a way to "queue" events, but did not necessarily need queue functionality,
as we always process all events, requests etc.

\subsubsection{Alternatives}
Could just have used a regular locked queue.

\subsubsection{Pros}
Fast, lock-free, allocates from lock-free allocator, reuses memory.

\subsubsection{Cons}
No queue functionality, so does not support being able to stop processing,
and continue to iterate, before processing more.

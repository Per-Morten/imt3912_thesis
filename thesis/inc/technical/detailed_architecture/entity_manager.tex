\section{Entity Manager}
\label{subsec:detailed_entity_manager}
The entity manager is the main API presented to the user for interaction with NOX ECS.
Any interaction related to entities or components is communicated through the entity manager, which is responsible for organizing and managing the different entities inhabiting the ECS.
It allows the NOX ECS to present an interface without exposing direct internal functionality, which is a desirable feature.

\subsection{Explanation}
The main idea behind the entity manager is pretty simple.
It consists of several collections of the different registered component types,
a thread pool, queues for transition requests, event queues, and a counter
used to assign entity ids.

\subsubsection{Lifecycle Transition}
The entity manager is responsible for transitioning a component between different stages in the lifecycle\secref{subsec:high_level_lifecycle} upon requests.
This operation is done asynchronously through the different step functions in the entity manager.
Up until such a step is invoked, the entity manager simply keeps a collection of all requests that needs to be processed.

\subsubsection{Steps}
As described in the update cycle, entities respond to different stages in a cycle during a frame. Managing these various stages is the entity managers job, and it is done through the different step functions.
Furthermore, these steps can either be called individually or through a convenience function, allowing for both control and convenience.

\subsubsection{Parallelism}
Currently, only three of the stages in the update cycle are parallelized, which is
the distribution of logic events, entity events, and the update stage.
The rationale being that these steps are the only ones that include several collections, and benefit from the parallelism, as each thread is simply given a separate collection to execute a task on.
The execution layers are what decides the direct "scheduling" of these tasks\secref{subsec:detailed_execution_layers}.

\subsection{Motivation for Entity Manager}
\subsubsection{Single Entry Point}
The entity manager is the single entry point for all communication in NOX ECS,
whether it be component requests, sending events, or access to resources like the
logic context of the application.

\subsubsection{Clean Interface - Expandable Interior}
There is a desire for a clean entity manager interface, that would allow for easy expansion and change of the interior functionality.

\subsubsection{Minimum dependency on NOX Engine}
It was desirable to avoid too heavy dependencies with the NOX Engine.
The new ECS were supposed to test some new ideas, and stay relatively decoupled from
the rest of the NOX Engine.
This approach was the rationale behind the decision to have a single hub object, as it would allow a single point of integration with the NOX Engine.
Currently, it is only the entity manager that relies on some of the old NOX Engine functionality, like the event system.

\subsubsection{Synchronization points}
One of the requirements\reqref{req:multi_threading} was to supply multi-threading, in a way that was relatively invisible to the user.
The entity manager would help in solving this requirement by creating clear "synchronization" points.
Each time a step function starts, multiple threads would launch
and once the step finished, the program would be back in a single threaded "state."

\subsection{Alternatives to Entity Manager}
The main alternative to having a hub object like the entity manager would be to require
the user to organize all of these themselves, which was not an option, as the system was supposed to be relatively easy to use.

\subsection{Pros of Entity Manager}
The main advantage of the entity manager is how it allows a relatively clean integration
with the NOX Engine, and provides an API rather simple to use.

\subsection{Cons of Entity Manager}
There is one main disadvantage to the entity manager, which is that components,
after inheriting from the base class component are tied to the entity manager, introducing
unnecessary coupling between the components and the manager. This coupling should not be much of an issue, as changing entity systems rarely happens during development.
A comment could also be made that the entity manager has somewhat turned into a blob object,
as its responsibilities span some different domains. This is not an issue
as the main idea, was for the entity manager to be a single interface,
and its objective is mainly routing requests forward to the correct providers.

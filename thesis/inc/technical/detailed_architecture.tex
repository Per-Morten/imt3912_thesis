\section{Detailed Architecture}
The detailed architecture section will describe in greater detail the different structures that is used in
NOX ECS, including motivations, advantages, disadvantages, alternatives and the longevity of the structure choices.

\todo{Section this differently, perhaps sections:
ECS, (Everything in ECS folder except: Factory, component collection?)Mainly motivated by lack of virtuals and templates)
Memory, (Includes component collection?, mainly motivated by contigious memory)
Threading, (Including lock free allocator), motivated by contigious memory and threading.}

% Basic stuff, building blocks
\todo{Ask mariusz if these sections should actually be grouped in sections like the list below.
    And have motivation on a per section basis, rather than per type basis.
    for example many of the basic building blocks share the same motivations etc.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Basic building blocks
        \begin{itemize}
            \item component
            \item operation types
            \item meta information
            \item type identifier
        \end{itemize}

        \item Usage in ECS
        \begin{itemize}
            \item component collection
            \item smart handle
            \item entity manager
            \item event
        \end{itemize}

        \item Misc
        \begin{itemize}
            \item execution layers
            \item lock free allocator
            \item thread pool
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
}

\todo{Properly indicate that the different sections are actually choices.}
\todo{Add the section name to subsection headlines to more easily follow the topic we are talking about,
example: Alternatives to Operation Types}
\todo{Add to the headlines that pros and cons are pros and cons to our solutions}

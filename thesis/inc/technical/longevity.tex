\section{Longevity}
All the design choices where based upon the requirements laid down by Suttung,
based on the current situation of the company and the NOX Engine.
The following section will discuss the longevity and future relevance of
these choices.
One could argue that we should design our program more for the changing future,
and adapt the program towards these coming changes.
However, we would argue that while a lot of these features can make some of our choices
irrelevant, waiting for future changes does not solve the current problems that
Suttung are facing.

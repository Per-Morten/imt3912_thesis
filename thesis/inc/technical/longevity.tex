\chapter{Technical - Longevity}
\label{chap:technical_longevity}
All the design choices were based on the requirements laid down by Suttung,
based on the current situation of the company and the NOX Engine.
The following section will discuss the longevity and future relevance of
these choices.
One could argue that the program's design should take the changing future into account, moreover, adapt the program towards these coming changes.
However, while a lot of these features can make some of the choices
irrelevant, waiting for future changes does not solve the current problems that
Suttung is facing.

\chapter{Conclusion}
\label{chap:conclusion}
The thesis has shown an implementation of a multi-threaded entity
component system within the NOX Engine, and discussed the different
findings of such a process.
While we were not able to do proper representative and repeated test,
we do believe that the findings can be relevant to other parties which has
an interest in entity component systems and mulit-threading.
Although we are not entirely happy with the end result,
we are extremely thankful for the experiences gained during the project.
Developing the NOX ECS has allowed us to learn more about optimization techniques,
as well as a deeper understanding of how the C++ language works.
We have also gained experience with integration and development within a larger codebase,
and the challenges that this incur.
These experiences are great contributions to our long journey to becoming better developers,
and we believe that once finished the NOX ECS will a great addition to the NOX Engine.

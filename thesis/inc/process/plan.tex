\section{Plans}
As soon as the project was decided we started planning how the development would
be executed, and the different aspects that needed to be covered.
The original sprint plan can be seen in appendix\footnote{The original plan was aimed at a entity component system closers to that of Adam Martin\protect\cite{t_machine_entity_systems}} \todo{Add ref}.
Additionally we started writing up specifications like the test case plan \todo{Add ref to appendix}
and a technical specification of what Suttung needed\todo{Add ref to appendix}.

\subsection{Re-planning}
On two different occasions we had to re-plan the project.
This was needed after seeing that we were not progressing at the pace we originally
intended.
These plans can be found in appendix \todo{Add ref} and \todo{Add ref}, however they are not as
detailed as the original plan.

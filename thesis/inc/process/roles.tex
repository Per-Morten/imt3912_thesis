\section{Roles}
There was a clear separation of roles within the development of NOX ECS.
Trond Lohne were mainly in charge of developing the test cases for both the NOX engine,
and the proposed ECS.
The role included setting up the benchmark test cases, and various scripts for running these.
Additionally Trond took on the role as technical support, with the responsibility of ensuring
good build chains.
Per-Morten Straume was in charge of the original prototype of the ECS, as well as the current implementation,
with the exception being the execution layers algorithm.
Per-Morten was also the project lead, holding the daily scrum meetings, and ensuring the progress was being made.

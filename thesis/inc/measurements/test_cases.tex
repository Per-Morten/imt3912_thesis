\section{Test Cases}

\subsection{Purpose}
The purpose of the tests are to measure and quantify the different types of optimizations and choices that has been made to the ECS.
The results of each test is supposed to give an idea as to how well the ECS system compares to the original nox engine in a couple of different cases.

\subsection{Changes}
In the original test case plan\todo{Add reference here} there were a couple of requirements and goals that were not achieved or changed.
These include the fact that only the GCC compiler was used, instead of three which also included Clang and MSVC to be used in the test cases.
The decision to leave those two compilers out was mainly due to time constraints, as the time it took to run all the tests was already taking a couple of days with only GCC.

High level overview of the document.
Everything written here will obviously be explained further in the proper thesis, this is just to try and give a general skeleton.
Section and chapter names might not be exactly the same either,
however the flow will be like this outline.

We have chosen to split the document a bit more to have a larger difference on what
that is related to the benchmark results etc, and how we worked.
Up until the process chapter, we are not really talking anything about how we worked and planned,
but rather what we are researching and the results of our implementation.
The process chapter is where we start talking about how we were doing planning,
scrum models, changes during development etc etc.

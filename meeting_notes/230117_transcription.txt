"Meeting - Simon McCallum
Topic:
Confirmed another topic change. Want to implement an ECS system into the NOX engine.
We were wondering how we could expand the project, and that it was big enough for bachelor.

There are different ways to expand the project. We could add more development topics i.e. features, or we could focus more on the research aspect of the thesis. 
The research aspect would entail analyzing different approaches to developing Entity Component Systems, giving us a greater understanding as well as functioning like a foundation for our choices.

We also discussed different research strategies, primary vs secondary research. We are probably leaning more towards the secondary research approach. 

Discussions on different source and academic literature approaches, and what sources were acceptable.
Static sources were preferred, however blog's etc can be used.

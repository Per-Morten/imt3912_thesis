\subsubsection*{General}
In addition to the requirements detailed below, the implementation of the new ECS. 

\ptparagraph{Interfacing Against Existing Engine Modules}
The NOX Engine is quite large, with several different modules already implemented. 
The new ECS implementation must be able to work with the existing modules within the NOX Engine. 
The exception being the already existing actor and component system.

\ptparagraph{Creation of Standard Components}
The old ECS already had some standard components within the engine. 
Most of these components should also be supplied within the new ECS.

\ptparagraph{Multi-threading}
The new ECS shall be multi-threaded as to improve efficiency.
Because of this, 
some other parts of the engine might need some added functionality, 
for example a modification to the logging system to ensure it is thread safe.

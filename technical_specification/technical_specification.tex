\subsection*{Functional Requirements}
- 200+ different components,
- Multi-threading support,
- Thread safe logging system,
- Create actors through json and code,
- Creation of standard components,
- Interface against already existing engine modules,

\subsection*{Quality Requirements}

- Compile time should not be increased to a large degree,
- Memory usage should not grow to a large extent,
- Security trumps performance, 
- Can choose which system to use when starting a new project,
    - However supporting changing system during development is not a priority.

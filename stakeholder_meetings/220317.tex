\subsubsection*{New tasks from our stakeholder}
\begin{itemize}
    \item
    Add documentation reserving a certain numeric range for NOX standard components: 0-999.
    
    \item    
    Would be nice to be able to write string values for identifiers in json for standard components, not just numerical values.

    \item
    Would be nice if the user could supply their own map of names to identifiers for json components.

    \item
    We will not be implementing a physics module, it would be too much work.
    
    \item
    Saving does not need to happen concurrently with update loops.
\end{itemize}
